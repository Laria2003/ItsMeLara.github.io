                <h2>GAMING</h2>
                <p>Reason why I love to play games because they are an escape from my sometimes boring 
                    and monotonous life. Puzzle games, Simulation games and Role-playing games are my 
                    favorites. In my opinion, games give me the sense of accomplishment when I complete a game like 
                    puzzle games. My all-time favorite game to play is Genshin Impact, this is a Role-playing game and I love
                    to play it like everyday when I go home after school.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h2>WATCH MOVIES AND SERIES</h2>
                <p>Whenever I am free, I love to watch movies and anime series. I spend my leisure time watching these. 
                    Watching movies or series encouraged me to feel more positive and inspired. My favorite all-time movie is Howl's Moving Castle,
                    this is a Ghibli type movie and I always watch this because of the art and quality of the movie and the lessons that I learned in the movie.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h2>READING</h2>
                <p>The most simple reason why I love reading is that I'm a lifelong reader and have always loved the world of words. 
                    The platform that I use to read books is Wattpad or I buy books myself. I started reading Wattpad in my junior high school days, my friend recommended it to me to try it.
                    My favorite genres are romance, fantasy, comedy, teen-fiction and many more. I also read manga and comics like my favorite Solo Leveling.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h2>LISTENING TO MUSICS</h2>
                <p>I love listening to music. It makes me feel good about myself and gives me a sense of freedom.
                    And when I'm sad, it makes me happy. I love every type of genres in musics. My favorite to play is Regression by HOYO-MiX, Ayanga.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h2>COOKING</h2>
                <p>Cooking is a medium to express yourself. This is an art that can be done in several ways and the possibilities are
                    endless. I can use my imagination and creativity to create a masterpiece like in baking. I do cooking and baking sometimes to make something special
                    for my father and to express my love and gratitude. I know this is tiring hobby but it's worth it when I see my loved ones
                    satisfied with my cooking. My favorite foods are Pork Adobo, Sinigang and Kaldereta.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h2>DANCING</h2>
                <p>Dance is a form of expression that brings people together, allows them to be creative in new ways and is a fantastic way to escape the
                    stresses and cares of everyday life. That's why I love to dance especially zumba or hip hop, this makes me feel energised and calm. It also clears my mind
                    and gives me a natural energy boost.

                <h2>I'm Lara Sophia Claudine B. Jamandre</h2>
                <p>Hey there, I'm Lara but my friends and family call me Lars or Laluy.
                    I'am 19 years old and I was born on November 10,2003 in Manila but I grew up and live with my father in Pangasinan.
                    My zodiac sign is Scorpio and the meaning of my name is "Protection". I'am the only child and unica hija in my family. I speak English, Tagalog, Ilocano and a little
                    bit of Japanese but I'm not that good with Japanese because I'm still learning and improving it. I'm a gamer and a college student taking Bachelor of Science Information Technology
                    at Pangasinan State University. I have 2 pet dogs and I love to eat foods especially sweets but I'm a picky eater and
                    I also love going out to hang out with my friends or having my alone time. My favorite colors are Green, Purple, Brown and White.
                    I'm a friendly, kind, polite and cheerful girl so don't be afraid to make friends with me, it's not hard to approach me to try making friends with me.
                    I'am also a supportive friend to my bestfriends and making sure that we have each others back. My dream destination is Japan and my dream one day I become a
                    successful person to make my parents proud. If you want to learn more about myself just contact me and I will try to reach out to you.
